The covid source data was available from the [Adaptive Biotechnologies ImmuneRACE](https://immunerace.adaptivebiotech.com/more-data-and-whats-coming-next/) under [Terms of Use](https://immunerace.adaptivebiotech.com/data-terms-of-use/) which allow redistribution of the Data. 

The processed data provided here are used in the publication 'TITAN: T Cell Receptor Specificity Prediction]{TITAN: T Cell Receptor Specificity Prediction with Bimodal Attention Networks', Anna Weber, Jannis Born, Maria Rodriguez Martinez.
We provide a two 10-fold crossvalidation splits: 1) tcr split (No Overlap between TCRs in train and test set) and 2) strict split (No Overlap between TCRs or epitopes in train and test set). Negative samples were generated by shuffling within each fold. *+covid files contain Covid data in addition to samples from VDJ. Unsplitted data is also provided. 
epitopes.* files contain epitope IDs and sequences as amino acid (*=csv) or SMILES string (*=smi). tcr*.csv files contain TCR IDs and amino acid sequences, either CDR3 beta sequence or full variable beta chain sequence (*=_full). 
allinfo_full_data+covid.csv contains all information (epitope sequences as amino acid and smiles, tcr sequence as cdr3 and full, label of interaction) aggregated in one file.

Additionally, we provide a trained model. The model was pretrained on BindingDB data and semi frozen during fine-tuning. We provide training parameter files, the model weights (done_training_bimodal_mca.pt) that can be loaded with the evaluation script and the exact data used to train and test the model (trained_model_train.csv and trained_model_test.csv)
